# Overlunky

An overlay for Spelunky 2 to help you with modding, exploring the depths of the game and practicing with tools like spawning arbitrary items, warping to levels and teleporting made by the cool people from the Spelunky Community Discord.

## Features
Current features and their keyboard shortcuts:
  - **F-keys**: Collapse/Show the window
  - **F1**: Search and spawn entities where you're standing
      + **Enter**: Spawn entity
      + **Ctrl+Arrows**: Move spawn coordinates around you
      + **Ctrl+Enter**: Teleport to coordinates
      + Enter multiple numeric IDs like `554 556 566` to spawn them all at once. Useful for making a kit you can just paste in.
  - **F2**: Spawn a warp door to any world, level and theme
      + **Enter**: Spawn door. Set the appropriate theme theme too or you will get weird results.
  - **F11**: Hide overlay completely for screenshots and faking being a god gamer
